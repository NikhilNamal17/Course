# Task 15 - Conclusion and What's next. 

## Objectives

- What's next? 

## Conclusion

You have built your first project on Postgre, React, Redux, NodeJS, Docker and Kubernetes. You''ve leant about builing API's on the server, working with a frontend library called React and how that makes your life easier. You've also learnt about working with Redux and state management on your frontend apps and have containerized your application and deployed it to Kubernetes Clusters. 

Kubernetes works on any cloud out there. Be it Google Cloud Platform, Azure, AWS or Digital Ocean. If you're curious - you can create an account there and deploy your service out to public. All of these services give you feww tier that should be sufficient for experimental use. 

There are two options for you going forward. On one hand you can continue to build your own projects, launch them, talk to potential customers and sell it. Talk to customers, get feedback, iterate and hopefully get some more people to join you in your journey and build a company. If you're a student, we highly recommend this approach. Keep working on projects, and you'll eventually learn. Work first, learn second. On the other hand - there are some of the best companies around that you can work for. We at HackerBay are always looking for people to join us and if you would like to interview with us. [Please check this out.](https://github.com/hackerbay/interview).
